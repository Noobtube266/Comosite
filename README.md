-Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy.
-It defines class hierarchies that contain primitive and complex objects.
-Think of it as a family tree where it all branches off and keeps branching off starting at a specific point
